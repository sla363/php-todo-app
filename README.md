# PHP ToDo App

## Overview

I have decided to create a simple todo app without using any framework or external packages (except for dev tools like PHPStan, Symfony VarDumper etc.). Therefore as I'm developing this app I'm writing my own framework to handle functionalities which are typically available in MVC frameworks such as routing, service autowiring, rendering pseudo-html templates and so on. The "framework" is by no means perfect; the goal here is to explore and learn and try to build stuff without relying on external packages.
